# Wine Classification with scikitlearn

This Project demonstrates how to work on the **Wine dataset** to classify types of wine using the **scikit-learn** library in Python. Four different machine learning classification algorithms will be apply on the wine dataset to train and evaluate a resulting model:
    - Logistic Regression, 
    - Decision Tree, 
    - Random Forest und 
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The results are stored in an SQLite database

---

### Features:
- **Load Wine dataset from scikit-learn and Quality check**
- **Create a data profile report** which includes statistics of the features, such as mean, median, range, and standard deviation using the Data Profiler
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handle missing values if any
  - Perform feature scaling or normalization if necessary
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets
- **Model Training with Cross-Validation**
  - ensure that the model doesn't overfit
  - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearch:** Utilize **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance
- **Logging:** log important steps of the data processing and model training phases
- **Configuration Management**
- **Results Storage:** the results from different training phases will be into an SQLite database
- **Model Persistence:** Save the trained models using both **pickle** and **Joblib** for later use or deployment
- **Project Organization**
  - For each training cycle starts, create a new folder with the current date and time to store all results (data profiles, models, SQLite database, etc.).
